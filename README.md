# Python Booter for Programs + LoadX Module
This is a bootloader and module loader python script that you can use to boot your program with pre-boot features! (may include shell elements)

# Download
Go to the downlad folder and you can use either uncompiled or compiled! Then make game_boot the program to run your game, and to execute your game (with LoadX) run main_boot.py or
look for the keyword main_boot!

# LoadX help
Go to the github.io folder and open index.html, download it, and view it in your browser.

# Download Help (Windows 10)
Get http://cygwin.com/ and you should be good with Python and Shell both installed, and maybe even Batch.
