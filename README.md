# Python Booter for Programs + LoadC Module
This is a bootloader and module loader python script that you can use to boot your program with pre-boot features! (may include shell elements)

# Download
Go to the downlad folder and you can use either uncompiled or compiled! Then make game_boot the program to run your game, and to execute your game (with LoadX) run main_boot.py or
look for the keyword main_boot!

# LoadC help
Go to the github.io folder and open index.html, download it, and view it in your browser.

# Download Help (Windows 10)
Get http://cygwin.com/ and you should be good with Python and Shell both installed, and maybe even PowerShell.

# Running Help
If there is a error, try renaming (only if you got the basic gui version) rename the Basic (with GUI) folder to Basic, that should fix it! Any other problems, please report them at our Issues or to averywstafford@gmail.com.
